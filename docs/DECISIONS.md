### D-001 · 2026-10-24 · Python 3.11 + `uv` with a committed `uv.lock`
- **Why:** brief asks for 3.11. All tools support it (TurboFlow needs ≥3.11, BoTorch ≥3.11).
  Note: numpy ≥2.5 and scipy ≥1.18 require Python ≥3.12, so on 3.11 we get numpy 2.3.x /
  scipy 1.17.x — fine. `uv.lock` is cross-platform (one lock for the cloud container and the
  workstation).
- **Alternatives:** conda (heavier, slower solves; nothing here needs conda-only binaries).
- **Status:** accepted (Phase 0).

### D-002 · 2026-10-24 · Override TurboFlow's `numpy<2` and `CoolProp<7` pins
- **Problem:** TurboFlow 0.1.18 (latest) declares `numpy<2`, `CoolProp<7`, while OpenMDAO
  ≥3.42 and SALib ≥1.5.2 require `numpy>=2`. No single resolvable environment exists
  with the declared metadata.
- **Decision:** `[tool.uv] override-dependencies` lets TurboFlow install with numpy 2.3.5 and
  CoolProp 8.0.0.
- **Evidence:** TurboFlow's own regression suite (`tests/test_performance_analysis.py`, 7
  configs covering loss models Benner / Kacker–Okapuu / Moustapha / Ainley–Mathieson and all
  choking criteria) was run in this environment. All 188 reported mismatches are in
  solver bookkeeping only (`norm_residual`, `func_count`, `grad_count`); every physical
  output (efficiencies, torque, flow angles, enthalpies, …) agrees with the stored
  references to all 6 significant figures printed (the suite itself demands 10 digits).
- **Alternatives:** (a) a numpy-1.26 environment: forces OpenMDAO ≤3.41 *and* is incompatible
  with current pyCycle fixes; (b) separate venv for TurboFlow called via subprocess — kept
  as a fallback if a future TurboFlow/CoolProp combination breaks.
- **Status:** accepted; re-run TurboFlow's regression suite after any numpy/CoolProp upgrade.

### D-003 · 2026-10-24 · Install pyCycle from git commit `ee7e161` instead of PyPI 4.4.0
- **Problem:** PyPI `om-pycycle` 4.4.0 (Oct 2025) crashes in `thermo_add.py` ("setting an
  array element with a sequence") with numpy 2.x — reproduced with both OpenMDAO 3.45.1 and
  3.41.0 (pyCycle issue #116). The fix is on master (PR #117, May 2026) but unreleased.
- **Decision:** pin `om-pycycle @ git+…/pyCycle@ee7e16126a7a54b5fe35292c53b7eb4e9572620b`
  (reports version 4.4.1.dev0) with OpenMDAO 3.45.1.
- **Note:** the README compatibility table stops at pyCycle 4.2.0 ("OpenMDAO 3.10 or greater"),
  so it does not cover 4.4.x; compatibility was established empirically (example runs + our
  regression test).
- **Status:** accepted; switch to the next PyPI release once it contains PR #117.

### D-004 · 2026-10-24 · Constrain `numpy>=2.0,<2.4`
- **Why:** with numpy 2.4.6, pyCycle's `simple_turbojet.py` viewer fails ("only 0-dimensional
  arrays can be converted to Python scalars") — numpy 2.4 turned a long-deprecated
  conversion into an error, and pyCycle code still relies on it. numpy 2.3.5 works (with a
  DeprecationWarning). OpenMDAO also excludes 2.4.0.
- **Status:** accepted; revisit when pyCycle is numpy-2.4 clean.

### D-005 · 2026-10-24 · PyTorch from PyPI (`torch==2.14.1`, bundles CUDA 13.0 on Linux)
- **Why:** simplest reproducible source; on Linux the PyPI wheel already contains CUDA 13
  runtime libraries. (The PyTorch wheel index `download.pytorch.org` is also blocked by the
  cloud container's network policy.)
- **Implication:** the workstation's NVIDIA driver must support CUDA 13.0. On Windows the
  PyPI wheel is CPU-only — would need an explicit PyTorch index. **Open question to user.**
- **Status:** provisional until the workstation is confirmed.

### D-006 · 2026-10-24 · Config = YAML + pydantic, `null` for un-researched values
- Strict schemas (`extra="forbid"`) catch typos; `extends:` for study configs; `require()`
  makes un-researched values fail loudly instead of defaulting silently.

### D-007 · 2026-10-24 · Run logging with plain run directories (no MLflow yet)
- `runs/<UTC>_<name>/{config.yaml, meta.json, results…}` with git hash, dirty flag, versions,
  seed. MLflow can be added in Phase 5 if experiment comparison needs it.

### D-008 · 2026-10-24 · pre-commit with local hooks (`uv run ruff` / `uv run black`)
- Hooks use the lock-pinned tool versions, so pre-commit and CI/IDE never disagree.
